In this project I have utilized the [google/flan-t5-large]([https://textsummarizer-yd7x.onrender.com/](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-large?text=Translate+to+German%3A++My+name+is+Arthur)) model from google that is avilable in hugging face. this website makes a call in to the model to send the text from the website to the model's api endpoint and captures the response and show in the website.

# Objective
